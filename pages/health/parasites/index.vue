      <h1>Fish Parasites</h1>
      <p>
        All wild, living animals, including Nevada fishes, have the potential to
        be infected with parasites. Parasites are organisms that live internally
        (endoparasite) or attach to the outside (ectoparasite) of a host. In
        this case, the host is a fish. If parasites occur in large numbers on a
        single fish, they can become harmful and possibly cause the fish to die.
        However, population die-offs from parasite infestations are rare and
        usually not a concern to fishery managers. Although parasites infecting
        fish may look disgusting or appear unappetizing, they are generally
        harmless to humans.

      <p>
        Safe Fish Preparation: Most parasites specific to infecting fish will
        not infect or harm you including when you handle it or even if you eat
        it raw. However, with some species of parasites, there is a chance you
        can become infected and, therefore, you should always take precautions.
        It is recommended after catching and cleaning a fish, you wash your
        hands. All fish will be safe to eat when thoroughly cooked. Cook fish to
        at least 140Â°F (usually when the flesh becomes opaque and flaky). This
        way, if your fish is infected with a parasite, it will be killed, making
        the fish completely safe to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dogs should not lick or consume raw trout or salmon. Fish infected with
        the parasite Nanophyetus and having the bacteria Neorickettesia can
        infect dogs with Salmon Poisoning Disease. This can become fatal if
        untreated. Although we have not heard of any cases in Nevada, it has
        been found in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. If your dog has
        eaten raw fish caught from a nearby lake or river and becomes ill
        (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or lethargic), bring it to
        your veterinarian and mention the fish.

        The common parasites you may encounter from fish caught in Nevada are
        described below.
      </p>

      <h2>Endoparasites</h2>
      <p>
        There are several types of internal parasites that can occur in all
        fishes and ones that you may occasionally come across in Nevada.
        Flatworms such as flukes and tapeworms are usually never seen unless, at
        times when you clean your catch. They can be found within the gut and
        intestine, in or on organs, in the body cavity, or within the flesh.
        Fish are edible and washing up after cleaning your catch and cooking
        fish thoroughly is advisable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roundworms are another type of internal parasite, which occur in the
        body cavity or under the skin. Those in the body cavity can be readily
        seen near the stomach and intestines when cleaning your catch. Fish are
        edible and washing up after cleaning your catch and cooking fish
        thoroughly is advisable.
      </p>

      <h2>Ectoparasites</h2>
      <p>
        Flukes (flatworms) also can be found attached to fins, skin, gills, or
        inside the mouth. Fish are edible and washing up after cleaning your
        catch and cooking fish thoroughly is advisable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parasitic copepods (crustaceans) can attach to gills, mouth, or embed
        into the skin. A common parasite on fishes (from bass, bluegill, trout,
        minnows to many of the native fish species) in Nevada is Lernaea, or
        anchor worm. Anchor worms burrow head first through the skin into the
        flesh and have the tail end exposed causing visible red sores or
        pustules. They are easily plucked out or are usually removed when you
        skin the fish. Then cook your catch as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another common ectoparasite in warmer waters is Ich, causing white spot
        disease. It is a single-celled protozoan found in clumps causing
        multiple tiny, white spots over the skin or bumps under the skin of
        fish. Again, it is not harmful to humans, so clean and cook as usual, or
        skin the fish if you prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common in many of the cooler waters in Nevada are leeches,
        small-segmented worms that attach to the body of fish feeding on their
        blood. These can be easily removed and fish can be cleaned and cooked as
        usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fuzzy patches of fungus can be found on the body and gills of fish
        generally where there was an injury such as a cut or scrape. In
        addition, a fish improperly handled causes removal of the protective
        mucus covering and eventually it may become infected with fungus. The
        fish is still edible, but you may want to skin it and remove the
        infected section, then cook the fish thoroughly.
